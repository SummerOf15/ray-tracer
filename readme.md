#### functions

- It combines these following functions.

  [x] add objects(sphere)

  [x] reflection and refraction

  [x] material

  [x] texture

  [x] moving objects

  [x] moving camera(point light source)

  [x] acceleration based on OPENMP

- Some functions need to be finished:

### How to apply

#### windows

- Open Virtual Studio and create new projects

- add the header files and source files
- F5 to compile and run the program.
- If you want to use the openMP acceleration to speed up, open the openMP support configuration. 

#### linux

- use g++ to compile all files and generate the executable file.
